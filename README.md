# DEPRECATED: Use byu-calendar-components

> This provides vertical and horizontal tiles for calendar displays.

This component is utilized by the Drupal Module Calendar Widget : https://github.com/byuweb/calendar_widget_d7

  And also by the javascript option : https://github.com/byuweb/calendar_widget

  Both can be easily implemented. See the documentation for integration for either method here: https://calendar-test.byu.edu/how-use-calendar-widget
